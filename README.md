Most domestic smart meters have very limited computing power and thus lack the ability to perform detailed power grid analysis. The project team are working together, under the guidance of Dr. Eduardo Cotilla-Sanchez, to develop a GPU-accelerated smart meter alongside grid algorithms to allow for real-time analysis of large power grid cases.
